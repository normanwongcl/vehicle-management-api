# Requirements

## Task 1

Design a vehicle management API that for MVP will only cater for cars, but in the future will manage other vehicle types like boats, bikes, caravans etc.

API should expose endpoints to list vehicles, add new vehicle, delete vehicle and update vehicle.

## Task 2

Build a simple console application that uses the API above to generate hourly report.

## Expectations

- The solution must be in the form of a visual studio project ready to run. We are looking for use of latest .net technologies, coding patterns, practices and principles.
- Data may be persisted in any way you like. In memory is sufficient.
- Unit/Integration testing is encouraged
- Please push your code to a repo (e.g. Github/bitbucket).
